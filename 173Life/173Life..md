##### Quote 3.

	As written in The Botany Coloring Book
	>"Plants provide strong yet lightweight materials used in 
		construction. Many cultures rely upon plants to provide all or
		part of the materials used in shelter construction. In some 
		types of shelters, such as yurts and teepees, poles obtained 
		from plants are used as a basic framework, which are covered
		by animal skins or plant materials such as palm leaves. In other
		types of shelters, such as wood frame houses, wood is the major
		construction material.
