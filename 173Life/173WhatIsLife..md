#### Quote 1. 

	As witten in Anatomy and Physiology:

		aspects of your life"

### Quote 2.
	
	As written in The Botany Coloring Book (Young, 1982):
	>"The importance of plants to the survival of humans and other
		animals cannot be overemphasized. Our basic needs of food,
		shelter, clothing, and oxygen are provided, either directly or,
		indirectly, by plants"
		
### Quote 3.

	As written in The Botany Coloring Book (Young, 1982):
	>"Plants provide strong yet lightweight materials used in 
		construction. Many cultures rely upon plants to provide all or
		part of the materials used in shelter construction. In some 
		types of shelters, such as yurts and teepees, poles obtained 
		from plants are used as a basic framework, which are covered
		by animal skins or plant materials such as palm leaves. In other
		types of shelters, such as wood frame houses, wood is the major
		construction material.
		
### Quote 4
	
	As written in The Botany Coloring Book (Young, 1982):
	>"Light from the sun is the major source of energy for the earth. 
		Through photosynthesis, plants capture light energy and store it
		as organic chemical energy. We utilize this stored energy 
		internally through the combustion of food as an internal energy
		source and externally through the combustion of organic 
		materials, such as wood, as a heat or light energy source."
		
### Quote 5

	As written in The Botany Coloring Book (Young, 1982):
	>"All animals including hunans are heterotrophic. That is, they 
		cannot manufactor their own food from inorganic substances. 
		Instead, they must rely on organic materials as their food, or
		internal energy, source. Most plants are autotrophic. That is 
		they utilize an external energy source, such as the sun, to 
		manufacture energy-rich organic compounds from inorganic
		substances. We grow and harvest plants for direct consumption as
		food, such as cereals, fruits, and vegetables, or indirectly 
		as in the fodder and grains fed to livestock which are consumed
		as food.
		
### Quote 6

	As written in The Botany Coloring Book (Young, 1982):
	>"During the energy-capturing, food producing process of 
		photosynthesis, green plants split water and release oxygen into
		the atmosphere. This is the source of the atmospheric oxygen we
		breathe. Without the continual release of large quantities of 
		oxygen by green plants through photosynthesis, the free oxygen
		in the atmosphere would be depleted by the energy-releasing 
		processes, called respiration, of living organisms and by 
		combining with inorganic and dead organic materials through
		chemical oxidation (as in the rusting of iron and burning of 
		wood)."
		
### Quote 7

	As written in The Botany Coloring Book (Young, 1982):
	>"Some plants are very important in certain types of food processing.
		Yeast, a microscopic fungus, is important to us for baking and
		producing alcoholic beverages. For example, wine yeast utilize
		the natural sugar in grapes as an energy source (yeast are 
		heterotrophic). In doing so carbon dioxide gas, CO2, the fizz
		in champagne and beer, is released and alcohol is produced as
		a by-poduct. The increasing alcohol eventually kills the yeast
		and preserves the beverage from spoilage. In yeast bread baking,
		the CO2, released by the yeast during fermentation of sugar in
		the dough creates a dough filled with minute gas bubbles that
		expand during baking to produce a light, airy product.
		
		Some bacteria are also important in food processing. The 
		manufacture of many dairy products including, cheeses, yogurt,
		and sour cream, is based upon the activities of bacteria that 
		utilize milk as their food source. Enzymes secreted by the 
		bacteria alter the milk and by-products toxic to the bacteria
		eventually kill them and produce a storable preserved food.
		
### Quote 8
	
	As written in The Botany Coloring Book (Young, 1982):
	>"Some plants produce abundant amounts of long, thin cells called
	fibers that, because of their length and strength, are useful for 
	weaving. In much of the world, the cotton plant, Gossypium, is the 
	major source of plant fibers used to manufacture clothing. Other 
	plants, such as flax (Linnum) and hemp (Cannabis), provide coarse 
	fibers." 
	
### Quote 9
	
	As written in Anatomy & Physiology (J. G. B. et al 2017):
	>"Human **anatomy** is the scientific study of the body's structures.
	Some of these structures are very small and can only be observed and
	analyzed with the assistance of a microscope. Other larger structures
	can readily be seen, manipulated, measured, and weighed. The word
	"anatomy" comes from a Greek root that means "to cut apart." Human
	anatomy was first studied by observing the exterior of the body and
	observing the wounds of soldiers and other injuries. Later, 
	physicians were allowed to dissect bodies of the dead to augment 
	their knowledge. When a body is dissected, its structures are cut 
	apart in order to observe their physical attributes and their 
	relationships to one another. Dissection is still used in medical
	schools, anatomy courses, and in pathology labs. In order to observe
	structures in living people, however a number of imaging techniques
	have been developed. These techniques allow clinicians to visualize
	structures inside the living body such as a cancerous tumor or a
	fractured bone."
	
### Quote 10

	As written in Anatomy & Physiology (J. G. B. et al 2017):
	>"Like most scientific disciplines, anatomy has areas of
	specialization. **Gross anatomy** is the study of the larger 
	structures of the body, those visible without the aid of 
	magnification. Macro-means "large," thus, gross anatomy is also 
	referred to as macroscopic anatomy. In contrast, micro-means 
	"small," and **microscopic anatomy** is the study of structures
	that can be observed only with use of a microscope or other 
	magnification devices. Microscopic anatomy includes cytology, the
	study of cells and histology, the study of tissues. As the 
	technology of microscopes has advanced, anatomists have been able to
	observe smaller and smaller structures of the body, from slices of 
	large structures like the heart, to the three-dimensional structures
	of large molecules in the body."
