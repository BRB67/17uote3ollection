# The Old Testament of the King James Version of the Bible

## The First Book of Moses: Called Genesis

1:1 In the beginning God created the heavewn and the earth.

1:2 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was
upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the
face of the waters.

1:3 And God said, Let there be light; and there was light.

1:4 And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light
from the darkness.

1:5 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called 
Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.

1:6 And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the 
waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.

1:7 And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which
were under the firmament from the waters which were above the 
firmament: and it was so.

1:8 And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and 
the morning were the second day.

1:10 Ans God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together
of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.

1:11 And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb
yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose
seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.

1:12 And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed
after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself,
after his kind: and God saw that it was good.

1:13 And the evening and the morning were the third day.

1:14 And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the
heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs,
and for seasons, and for days, and years: 1:15 And let them be for
lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth:
and it was so.

1:16 And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day,
and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.

1:17 And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give
light upon the earth, 1:18 And to rule over the day and over the 
night, and to divide the light from the darkness: amd God saw that it
was good.

1:19 And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.

1:20 And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving 
creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the
open firmament of heaven.

1:21 And God created great whales, and every living creature that 
moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind,
and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.

1:22 And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and
fiill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.

1:23 And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.

1:24 And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature
after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after
his kind: and it was so.

1:25 And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle
after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after
his kind: and God saw that it was good.

1:26 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our 
likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and
over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth,
and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.

1:27 So God created man in his own image. in the image of God created
he him; male and female created he them.

1:28 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful,
and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have
dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and
over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.

1:29 And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing
seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the
which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.

1:30 Amd to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air,
and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life,
I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.

1:31 And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it
was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth
day.

2:1 Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host
of them.

2:2 And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had
made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he
had made.

2:3 And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because
that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and
made.

2:4 These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when
they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth
and the heavens, 2:5 And every plant of the field before it was in the
earth, and every herb of the field befgore it grew: for the LORD God
had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to
till the ground.

2:6 But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole 
face of the ground.

2:7 And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and
breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living
soul.

2:8 And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and
there he put the man whom he had formed.

2:9 And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree
that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also
in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.

2:10 And a river went out of Eden to water the garden;
and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.

2:11 The name of the first is Pison: that is it which
compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is
gold; 2:12 And the gold of that land is good: there is
bdellium and the onyx stone.

2:13 And the name of the second river is Gihon: the
same is it that comppasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.

2:14 And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is
it which goweth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth
river is Euphrates.

2:15 And the LORD God took the man, and put him
into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.

2:16 And the LORD God commanded the man, saying,
Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: 2:17
But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou
shall not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof
thou shalt surely die.

2:18 And the LORD God said, It is not good that the 
man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for
him.

2:19 And out of the ground the LORD God formed
every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and
brought thme unto Adam to see what he would call
them: and whatsoever Adam called every living
creature, that was the name thereof.

2:20 And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the 
fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for
Adam there was not found an help meet for him.

2:21 And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall
upon Adam, and he slep: and he took one of his ribs,
and closed up the flesh instead thereof; 2:22 And the rib,
which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a
woman, and brought her unto the man.

2:23 And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones,
and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman,
because she was taken out of Man.

2:24 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his
mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall
be one flesh.

2:25 And they were both naked, the man and his wife,
and were not ashamed.

3:1 Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of
the field which the LORD God had made. And he said 
unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of
every tree of the garden? 3:2 And the woman said unto
the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the
garden: 3:3 But of the fruit of the tree which is in the 
midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it,
neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.

3:4 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not
surely die: 3:5 For God doth know that in the day ye eat
thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ue shall be
as gods, knowing good and evil.

3:6 And when the woman saw that the tree was good 
for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree
to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit
thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with
her; and he did eat.

3:7 And the eyes of them both were, opened, and they 
knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves
together, and made themselves aprons.

3:8 And they heard the voice of the LORD God 
walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam
and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the
LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.

3:9 And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said
unto him, Where art thou? 3:10 And he said, I heard thy
voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was
naked; and I hid myself.

3:11 And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked?
Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee
that thpi shouldest not eat? 3:12 And the man said, The
woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of
the tree, and I did eat.

3:13 And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is
this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The
serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.

3:14 And the LORD God said unto the serpent,
Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all
cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly
shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy
life: 3:15 And I will put enmity between thee and the
woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall
buise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.

3:16 Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply
thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt
bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy
husband, and he shall rule over thee.

3:17 And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast
hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of
the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt
not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow
shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life; 3:18 Thorns
also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou
shalt eat the herb of the field; 3:19 In the sweat of thy
face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the
ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art,
and unto dust shalt thou return.

3:20 And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because
she was the mother of all living.

3:21 Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD
God make coats of skins, and clothed them.

3:22 And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is
become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now,
lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of
life, and eat, and live for ever: 3:23 Therefore the LORD
God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the 
ground from whence he was taken.

3:24 So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east
of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword
which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of
life.
