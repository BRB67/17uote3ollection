## The First Book of Moses: Called Genesis

1:1 In the beginning God created the heavewn and the earth.

1:2 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was
upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the
face of the waters.

1:3 And God said, Let there be light; and there was light.

1:4 And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light
from the darkness.

1:5 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called 
Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.

1:6 And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the 
waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.

1:7 And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which
were under the firmament from the waters which were above the 
firmament: and it was so.

1:8 And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and 
the morning were the second day.

1:10 Ans God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together
of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.

1:11 And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb
yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose
seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.

1:12 And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed
after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself,
after his kind: and God saw that it was good.

1:13 And the evening and the morning were the third day.

1:14 And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the
heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs,
and for seasons, and for days, and years: 1:15 And let them be for
lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth:
and it was so.

1:16 And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day,
and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.

1:17 And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give
light upon the earth, 1:18 And to rule over the day and over the 
night, and to divide the light from the darkness: amd God saw that it
was good.

1:19 And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.

1:20 And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving 
creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the
open firmament of heaven.

1:21 And God created great whales, and every living creature that 
moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind,
and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.

1:22 And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and
fiill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.

1:23 And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.

1:24 And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature
after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after
his kind: and it was so.

1:25 And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle
after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after
his kind: and God saw that it was good.

1:26 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our 
likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and
over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth,
and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.

1:27 So God created man in his own image. in the image of God created
he him; male and female created he them.

1:28 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful,
and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have
dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and
over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.

1:29 And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing
seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the
which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.

1:30 Amd to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air,
and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life,
I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.

1:31 And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it
was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth
day.

2:1 Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host
of them.

2:2 And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had
made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he
had made.

2:3 And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because
that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and
made.

2:4 These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when
they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth
and the heavens, 2:5 And every plant of the field before it was in the
earth, and every herb of the field befgore it grew: for the LORD God
had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to
till the ground.

2:6 But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole 
face of the ground.

2:7 And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and
breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living
soul.

2:8 And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and
there he put the man whom he had formed.

2:9 And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree
that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also
in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.

2:10 And a river went out of Eden to water the garden;
and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.

2:11 The name of the first is Pison: that is it which
compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is
gold; 2:12 And the gold of that land is good: there is
bdellium and the onyx stone.

2:13 And the name of the second river is Gihon: the
same is it that comppasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.

2:14 And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is
it which goweth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth
river is Euphrates.

2:15 And the LORD God took the man, and put him
into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.

2:16 And the LORD God commanded the man, saying,
Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: 2:17
But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou
shall not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof
thou shalt surely die.

2:18 And the LORD God said, It is not good that the 
man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for
him.

2:19 And out of the ground the LORD God formed
every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and
brought thme unto Adam to see what he would call
them: and whatsoever Adam called every living
creature, that was the name thereof.

2:20 And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the 
fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for
Adam there was not found an help meet for him.

2:21 And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall
upon Adam, and he slep: and he took one of his ribs,
and closed up the flesh instead thereof; 2:22 And the rib,
which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a
woman, and brought her unto the man.

2:23 And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones,
and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman,
because she was taken out of Man.

2:24 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his
mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall
be one flesh.

2:25 And they were both naked, the man and his wife,
and were not ashamed.

3:1 Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of
the field which the LORD God had made. And he said 
unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of
every tree of the garden? 3:2 And the woman said unto
the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the
garden: 3:3 But of the fruit of the tree which is in the 
midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it,
neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.

3:4 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not
surely die: 3:5 For God doth know that in the day ye eat
thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ue shall be
as gods, knowing good and evil.

3:6 And when the woman saw that the tree was good 
for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree
to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit
thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with
her; and he did eat.

3:7 And the eyes of them both were, opened, and they 
knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves
together, and made themselves aprons.

3:8 And they heard the voice of the LORD God 
walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam
and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the
LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.

3:9 And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said
unto him, Where art thou? 3:10 And he said, I heard thy
voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was
naked; and I hid myself.

3:11 And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked?
Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee
that thpi shouldest not eat? 3:12 And the man said, The
woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of
the tree, and I did eat.

3:13 And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is
this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The
serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.

3:14 And the LORD God said unto the serpent,
Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all
cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly
shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy
life: 3:15 And I will put enmity between thee and the
woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall
buise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.

3:16 Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply
thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt
bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy
husband, and he shall rule over thee.

3:17 And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast
hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of
the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt
not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow
shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life; 3:18 Thorns
also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou
shalt eat the herb of the field; 3:19 In the sweat of thy
face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the
ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art,
and unto dust shalt thou return.

3:20 And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because
she was the mother of all living.

3:21 Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD
God make coats of skins, and clothed them.

3:22 And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is
become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now,
lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of
life, and eat, and live for ever: 3:23 Therefore the LORD
God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the 
ground from whence he was taken.

3:24 So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east
of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword
which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of
life.

4:1 And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived,
and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the
LORD.

4:2 And she again bare his brother
Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep,
but Cain was a tiller of the ground.

4:3 And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain
brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the
LORD.

4:4 And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his
flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect
unto Abel and to his offering: 4:5 But unto Cain and to 
his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very
wroth, and his countenance fell.

4:6 And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou
wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen? 4:7 If thou
doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest
not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his
desire, and thou shalt rule over him.

4:8 And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came 
to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up
against Abel his brother, and slew him.

4:9 And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy
brother? And he said, I know not: Am I my brother's
keeper? 4:10 And he said, What hast thou done? the
voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the
ground.

4:11 And now art thou cursed from the earth, which
hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood
from thy hand; 4:12 When thou tillest the ground, it
shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a
fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.

4:13 And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is
greater than I can bear.

4:14 Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the
face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I
shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it 
shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall
slay me.

4:15 And the LORD said unto him, Therefore 
whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on 
him sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark upon Cain,
lest any finding him should kill him.

4:16 And Cain went out from the presence of the 
LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of
Eden.

4:17 And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and
bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name
of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.

4:18 And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat
Mehujael: and Mehajael begat Methusael: and 
Methusael begat Lamech.

4:19 And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name
of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.

4:20 Amd Adaj bare Jabal: he was the father of such as
dwell in tents, and of such as have cattle.

4:21 And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the
father of all such as handle the harp and organ.

4:22 And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructer
of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of
Tubalcain was Naamah.

4:23 And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah,
Hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my 
speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a 
young man to my hurt.

4:24 If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech
seventy and sevenfold.

4:25 And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a
son, and called his name Seth: For God, said she, hath
appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain
slew.

4:26 And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and
he called his name Enos: then began men to call upon
the name of the LORD.

5:1 This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the
day that God created man, in the likeness of God made
he him; 5:2 Male and female created he them; and
blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day
when they were created.

5:3 And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and
begat a son in his own likeness, and after his image; and
called his name Seth: 5:4 And the days of Adam after he
had begotten Seth were eight hundred years: and he
begat sons and daughters: 5:5 And all the days that
Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years: and he
died.

5:6 And Seth lived an hundred and five years, and
begat Enos: 5:7 And Seth lived after he begat Enos eight
hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters:
5:8 And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and 
twelve years: and he died.

5:9 And Enos lived ninety years, and begat Cainan:
5:10 And Enos lived after he begat Cainan eight hundred
and fifteen years, and begat sons and daughters: 5:11
And all the days of Enos were nine hundred and five
years: and he died.

5:12 And Cainan lived seventy years and begat 
Mahalaleel: 5:13 And Cainan lived after he begat
Mahalaleel eight hundred and forty years, and begat
sons and daughters: 5:14 And all the days of Cainan
were nine hundred and ten years: and he died.

5:15 And Mahalaleel lived sixty and five years, and
begat Jared: 5:16 And Mahalaleel lived after he begat
Jared eight hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and
daughters: 5:17 And all the days of Mahalaleel were 
eight hundred ninety and five years: and he died.

5:21 And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat
Methuselah: 5:22 And Enoch walked with God after he
begat Methuselah three hundred years, and begat sons
and daughters: 5:23 And all the days of Enoch were
three hundred sixty and five years: 5:24 And Enoch
walked with God: and he was not; for God took him.

5:25 And Methuselah lived an hundred eighty and
seven years, and begat Lamech.

5:26 And Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech
seven hundred eighty and two years, and begat sons and
daughters: 5:27 And all the days of Methuselah were 
nine hundred sixty and nine years: and he died.

5:28 And Lamech lived an hundred eighty and two
years, and begat a son: 5:29 And he called his name
Noah, saying, This same shall comfort us concerning our
work and toil of our hands, because of the ground which
the LORD hath cursed.

5:30 And Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah
begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

6:1 And it came to pass, when men began to multiply
on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto
them, 6:2 That the sons of God saw the daughters of 
men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all
which they chose.

6:3 And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always
strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days
shall be an hundred and twenty years.

6:4 There were giants in the earth in those days; and
also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the
daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the
same became mighty men which were of old, men of
renown.

6:5 And God saw that the wickedness of man was great
in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts
of his heart was only evil continually.

6:6 And it repented the LORD that he had made man
on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.

6:7 And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I
have created from the face of the earth; both man, and
beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air;
for it repenteth me that I have made them.

6:8 But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.

6:9 These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just
man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked
with God.

6:10 And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and 
Japheth.

6:11 The earth alsos was corrupt before God, and the
earth was filled with violence.

6:12 And God looked upon earth, and behold, it was corrupt; for
all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.

6:13 And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me;
for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold I 
will destroy them with the earth.

6:14 Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the
ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.

6:15 And this is the fashion which thou shalat make it of: The length
of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty
cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.

6:16 A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou
finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side
thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.

6:17 And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the
earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under
heaven; and ever thing that is in the earth shall die.

6:18 But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come
into the ark , thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives
with thee.

6:19 And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt
thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be
male and female.

6:20 Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of
every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort
shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.

6:21 And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and shalt
gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.

6:22 Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did
he.

7:1 And the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house intop the
ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation.

7:2 Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male
and his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and
his female.

7:3 Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; to
keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth.

7:4 For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth
forty days and forty nughts; and every living substance that I have
made will I destroy fromm off the face of the earth.

7:5 And Noah did according unto all that the LORD commanded him.

7:6 And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was
upon the earth.

7:7 And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives
with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.

7:8 Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls,
and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth, 7:9 There went in two
and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had
commanded Noah.

7:10 And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the
flood were upon the earth.

7:11 In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month,
the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains
of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.

7:12 And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.

7:13 In the selfsame day enetered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth,
the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons
with them, into the ark; 7:14 They, and every beast after his kind,
and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that
creepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind,
every bird of every sort.

7:15 And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all
flesh, wherein is the breath of life.

7:16 And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as
God had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in.

7:17 And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters
increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.

7:18 And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the
earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.

7:19 And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the
earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.

7:20 Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains
were covered.

7:21 And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and
of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth
upon the earth, and every man: 7:22 All in whose nostrils was the
breath of life, of all that was in the dry land, died.

7:23 And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face
of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the
fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah
only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.

7:24 And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty
days.

8:1 And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the
cattle that was with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over
the earth, and the waters asswaged; 8:2 The fountains also fo the deep
and the windows of heaven were stooped, and the rain from the heaven was
restrained; 8:3 Amd the waters returned from off the earth
continually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the
waters were abated.

8:4 Amd the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of
the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.

8:5 And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the
tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the 
mountains seen.

8:6 And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the
window of the ark which he had made: 8:7 And he sent forth a raven,
which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off
the earth.

8:8 Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were
abated from off the face of the ground; 8:9 But the dove found no rest
for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for
the waters were on the face of the whole earth: the he put forth his
hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark.

8:10 And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the
dove out of the ark; 8:11 And the dove came in to him in the evening;
and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf puckt off: so Noah knew that
the waters were abated from off the earth.

8:12 And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove;
which returned not again unto him any more.

8:13 And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the
first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from
off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked,
and

8:14 And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the
month, was the earth dried.

8:15 And God spake unto Noah, saying, 8:16 Go forth of the ark, thou,
and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee.

8:17 Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of
all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing
that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the 
earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.

8:18 And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons'
wives with him: 8:19 Every breast, every creeping thing, and every
fowl, and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went
forth out of the ark.

8:20 And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every clean 
beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the
altar.

8:21 And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his
heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for
the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I
again smite any more every thing living, as I have done.

8:22 While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and
heat, and summer ans winter, and day and night shall not cease.

9:1 And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be
fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.

9:2 And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast
of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth
upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are
they delivered.

9:3 Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the
green herb have I given you all things.

9:4 But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall
ye not eat.

9:5 And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of
every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of 
every man's brother will I reuire the life of man.

9:6 Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in
the image of God mad he man.

9:7 And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in
the earth, and multiply therein.

9:8 And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying, 9:9 And
I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after
you; 9:10 And with every living creature that is with you, of the
fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from
all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.

9:11 And I will establish my covenant with you, neither shall all
flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall
there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.

9:12 And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make
between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for
perpetual generations: 9:13 I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall
be for   a token of a covenant between me and the earth.

9:14 And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth,
that the bow shall be seen in the cloud: 9:15 And I will remember my 
covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all
flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all
flesh.

9:16 And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that 
I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living
creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.

9:17 And God said unto Noah, This is the tokem of the covenant, which
I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.

9:18 And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and
Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan.

9:19 These are the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth
overspread.

9:20 And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:
9:21 And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered 
within his tent.

9:22 And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father,
and told his two brethren without.

9:23 And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon their 
shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their
father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father\s
nakedness.

9:24 And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had
done unto him.

9:25 And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be
unto his brethren.

9:26 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall be
his servant.

9:28 And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.

9:29 And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty yrars: and
he died.

10:1 Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and
Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood.

10:2 The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and
Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.

10:3 And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.

10:4 And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and
Dodanim.

10:5 By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands;
every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.

10:6 And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.

10:7 And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah,
and Sabtechah: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan.

10:8 And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.

10:9 He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said,
Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD.

10:10 And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and
Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.

10:11 Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the
city Rehoboth, and Calah, 10:12 And Resen between Nineveh and Calah:
the same is a great city.

10:13 And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamin, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,
10:14 And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and
Caphtorim.

10:15 And Canaan begat Sidon his first born, and Heth, 10:16 And the
Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite, 10:17 And the Hivite,
and the Arkite, and the Sinite, 10:18 And the Arvadite, and the
Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the
Canaanites spread abroad.

10:19 And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidonn, as thou comest
to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and
Admah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha.

10:20 These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their
tongues, in their countries, and in their nations.

10:21 Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the
brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were children born.

10:22 The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud,
and Aram.

10:23 And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.

10:24 And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber.

10:25 And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg; for
in his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name was Joktan.

10:26 And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and
Jerah, 10:27 And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah, 10:28 And Obal, and
Abimael, and Sheba, 10:29 And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these
were the sons of Joktan.

10:30 And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a
mount of the east.

10:31 These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their
tongues, in their lands, after their nations.

10:32 These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their
generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided
in the earth after the flood.

11:1 And the whole earth was of one language,and of one speech.

11:2 And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east. that they
found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.

11:3 And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn
them thoroughly. And they had brick  for stone, and slime had they for
morter.

11:4 And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose
top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be 
scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.

11:5 And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the
children of men builded.

11:6 And the LORD said, Behold, the people is ome, and they have all
one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be
restrained from them, which they have imagined to do. 

11:7 Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that
they may not understand one another's speech.

11:8 So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of
all the earth: and they left off to build the city.

11:10 These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an hundred years
old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood: 11:11 And Shem
lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat sons and
daughters.

11:12 And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah: 11:13
And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three years,
and begat sons and daughters.

11:14 And Saalah lived thirty years, and begat Eber: 11:15 And Salah
lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons
and daughters.

11:16 And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg: 11:17 And
Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and
begat sons and daughters.

11:18 And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu: 11:19 And Peleg
lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons
and daughters.

11:22 And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor: 11:23 And serug
lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years. and begat sons and
daughters.

11:24 And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah: 11:25
And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen years,
and begat sons and daughters.

11:26 And Teraah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran.

11:27 Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram,
Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.

11:27 Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram,
Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.

11:28 And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity,
in Ur of the Chaldees.

11:29 And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wife
was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of
Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.

11:30 But Sarai was barren; she had no child.

11:31 And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's
son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they
went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of
Canaan; and they came unto HAran, and dwelt there.

11:32 And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah
died in Haran.

12:1 Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country,
and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I
will shew thee: 12:2 And I will make of thee a great nation, and I 
will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:
12:3 And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him
that curseth thee: and in the shall all families of the earth be blessed.

12:4 So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot went 
with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed
out of Haran.

12:5 And abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all
their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had
gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan;
and into the land of Canaan they came.

12:6 And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto
the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.

12:7 And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I
give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD, who
appeared unto him.

12:8 And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel,
and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east:
and there he builded an altar unto the LORD, and called upon the name 
of the LORD.

12:9 And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.

12:10 And there was a famaine in the land: and Abram went down into
Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.

12:11 And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt,
that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a
fair woman to look upon: 12:12 Therefore it shall come to pass, when
the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife:
and they will killl me, but they will save thee alive.

12:13 Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with
me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.

12:14 And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the
Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.

12:15 The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before
Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.

12:16 And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and
oxen, and he assesm and menservants, and maidservabts, and she asses,
and camels.

12:17 And the LORRD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues
because of Sarai Abram's wife.

12:18 And Pharaoh called Abram and said, what is this that thou hast
done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife? 12:19
Why saudst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to
wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.

12:20 And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him
away, and his wife, and all that he had.

13:1 And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he
had, and Lot with him, into the south.

13:2 And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.

13:3 And he went on his Journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto
the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and
Hai; 13:4 Unto the place of the altar, which he had make there at the
first: and there Abram called on the name of the LORD.

13:5 And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and
tents.

13:6 And the land was not able to bear them that they might dwell
together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell
together.

13:7 And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle and
the herdmen of Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite
dwelled then in the land.

13:8 And Abram said unto Lot, let there be no strife, I pray thee,
between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be
brethren.

13:9 Is not the whole land before thee? seperate thyself, I pray thee,
from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right;
or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.

13:10 And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan,
that it was well watered every where, before the LORD destroyed Sodom
and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt,
as thou comest unto Zoar.

13:11 Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed
east: and they seperated themselves the one from the other.

13:12 Abram dwelled in the land of Cannan, and Lot dwelled in the 
cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom.

13:13 But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the LORD
exceedingly.

13:14 And the LORD said unto Abram, affter that Lot was seperated from
him, Lift uo now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art
northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward: 13:15 For all
the land which thou seest, to the will I give it, and to thy seed for
ever.

13:16 And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a
man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be
numbered.

13:17 Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the
breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee.

13:18 Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of
Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the LORD.

14:1 And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar,
Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal King of
nations; 14:2 That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with 
Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of
Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.

14:3 All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is
the salt sea.

14:4 Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year
they rebelled.

14:5 And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that
were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the
Zuzims in Ham, and the Emins in Shaveh Kiriathaim, 14:6 And the
Horites in their mount Seir, unto Elparan, which is by the wilderness.

14:7 And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which is Kadesh, and
smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that
dwelt in Hazezontamar.

14:8 And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah,
and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela
(the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of
Siddim; 14:9 With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king
of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar;
four kings with five.

14:10 And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of
Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled
to the mountain.

14:11 And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their
victurals, and went their way.

14:12 And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom,
and his goods, and departed.

	2:1 Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?
	2:2 The Kings of earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel 
	together, against the LORD, and against his anointed, saying,
	2:3 Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from
	us.
	2:4 He tread.hat sitteth in the heavens shall laigh: the LORD shall have 
	them in derision.
	2:5 Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his 
	sore displeasure.
	2:6 Yet have I set my king upoon my holy hill of Zion.
	2:7 I will declare the decree:the LORD hath said unto me, Thou art
	my Son; this day have I begotten thee.
	2:8 Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance,
	and the uttermost  parts of the earth for thy possession.
	2:9 Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them
	in pieces like a potter's vessel.
	2:10 Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of

	2:11 Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling.

	3:2 Many there be which say of my soul, There is no help for him in
	God. 
	Selah.
	3:3 But thou, O LORD, art a shield for me; my glory; and the lifter 
	up of mine head.
	3:4 I cried unto the LORD with my voice, and he heard me out of his 
	holy hill. Selah.
	3:5 I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the LORD sustained me.
	3:6 I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set
	themselves against me round about.
	3:7 Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all mine
	enemies upon the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the 
	ungodly.
	3:8 Salvation belongeth unto the LORD: thy blessing is uhy people.
	Selah.
	4:1 Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast 
	enlarged me when I was in distress; have mercy upon me, and hear
	my prayer.
	4:2 O ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into sham? how
	long will ye love vanity, and seek after leasing? Selah.
	4:3 But know that the LORD hath set apart him that is godly for 
	himself: the LORD will hear when I call unto him.
	4:4 Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon your
	bed, and be still. Selah.
	4:5 Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the
	LORD.



	27:1 The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the LORD 
		is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?
