### Quote 1

	As written in Overcoming Gravity (Low, 2016):
	>"The primary goal of this book is to allow beginner and 
	intermediate athletes to delve into the world of bodyweight strength
	training and progress effectively and safely."
	
### Quote 2

	As written in Overcoming Gravity (Low, 2016):
	>"In the body the SAID principle rules all. The said principle is 
	simple: Specific Adaptation to Imposed Demands. Franklin Henry 
	proposed this concept in his hypothesis on motor learning. However,
	it applies to all systems of the body, including the muscles, 
	nervous systems, and connective tissues. The concept is straight 
	forward--if you can apply enough stress to the muscles and nervous
	system through intense exercise, the body will adapt to this stress
	by improving strength and muscular hypertrophy--an increase in size
	of the muscles. Over time, the application of additonal stress to 
	these systems of the body will result in large-scale adaptations in
	strength, hypertrophy, and connective tissue integrity. This is 
	called progressive overload.
	
### Quote 3

	As written in Overcoming Gravity (Low, 2016):
	>"Thomas Delorme pioneered the concept of progresssive overload 
	while rehabilitating soldiers after World War II. Progressive 
	overload is the key concept behind all strength and hypertrophy 
	training, including both barbell and bodyweight training, Generally
	speaking, you must progressively add more weight to the barbell in 
	order to increase strength and hypertrophy. Likewise, with 
	bodyweight exercises you must find a way to make the exercises more 
	difficult in order to progressively overload the body and gain 
	strength and hypertrophy.
	
### Quote 4

	As written in The Team Physician and Conditioning of Athletes for 
	Sports (Herring 2001):
	>"Conditioning is a process in which stimuli are created by an 
	exercise program performed by the athlete to produce a higher
	level of function
	
	The goal of conditioning is to optimize the performance of the 
	athlete and minimize the risk of injury and illness."
