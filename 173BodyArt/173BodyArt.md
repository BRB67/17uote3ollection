### Quote 2

	As written in Overcoming Gravity (Low, 2016):
	>"In the body the SAID principle rules all. The said principle is 
	simple: Specific Adaptation to Imposed Demands. Franklin Henry 
	proposed this concept in his hypothesis on motor learning. However,
	it applies to all systems of the body, including the muscles, 
	nervous systems, and connective tissues. The concept is straight 
	forward--if you can apply enough stress to the muscles and nervous
	system through intense exercise, the body will adapt to this stress
	by improving strength and muscular hypertrophy--an increase in size
	of the muscles.
