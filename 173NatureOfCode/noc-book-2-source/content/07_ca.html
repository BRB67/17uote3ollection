  <p>In this chapter, we’re going to take a break from talking about vectors and motion. In fact,
    the rest of the book will mostly focus on systems and algorithms (albeit ones that we can,
    should, and will apply to moving bodies). In the previous chapter, we encountered our first
    p5.js example of a complex system: flocking. We briefly stated the core principles behind
    complex systems: more than the sum of its parts, a complex system is a system of elements,
    operating in parallel, with short-range relationships that as a whole exhibit emergent behavior.
    This entire chapter is going to be dedicated to building another complex system simulation in
    p5.js. Oddly, we are going to take some steps backward and simplify the elements of our
    system. No longer are the individual elements going to be members of a physics world; instead we
    will build a system out of the simplest digital element possible, a single bit. This bit is
    going to be called a cell and its value (0 or 1) will be called its state. Working with such
    simple elements will help us understand more of the details behind how complex systems work, and
    we’ll also be able to elaborate on some programming techniques that we can apply to code-based
    projects.</p>

    <h2>7.1 What Is a Cellular Automaton?</h2>

      data-secondary="cellular automata" data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p>First, let’s get one thing straight. The term <strong><em>cellular automata</em></strong> is
      plural. Our code examples will simulate just one—a <strong><em>cellular
          automaton</em></strong>, singular. To simplify our lives, we’ll also refer to cellular
      automata as “CA.”</p>

    <p>In Chapters 1 through 6, our objects (mover, particle, vehicle, boid) generally existed in
      only one “state.” They might have moved around with advanced behaviors and physics, but
      ultimately they remained the same type of object over the course of their digital lifetime.
      We’ve alluded to the possibility that these entities can change over time (for example, the
      weights of steering “desires” can vary), but we haven’t fully put this into practice. In this
      context, cellular automata make a great first step in building a system of many objects that
      have varying states over time.</p>

    <a data-primary="cellular automaton (automata)" data-secondary="characteristics of"
      data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p>A cellular automaton is a model of a system of “cell” objects with the following
      characteristics.</p>

    <a data-primary="grid (cellular automata)" data-type="indexterm"></a> <a
      data-primary="state (cellular automata)" data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The cells live on a <strong><em>grid</em></strong>. (We’ll see examples in both one and
          two dimensions in this chapter, though a cellular automaton can exist in any finite number
          of dimensions.)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Each cell has a <strong><em>state</em></strong>. The number of state possibilities is
          typically finite. The simplest example has the two possibilities of 1 and 0 (otherwise
          referred to as “on” and “off” or “alive” and “dead”).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Each cell has a <strong><em>neighborhood</em></strong>. This can be defined in any number
          of ways, but it is typically a list of adjacent cells.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>The development of cellular automata systems is typically attributed to Stanisław Ulam and
      John von Neumann, who were both researchers at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New
      Mexico in the 1940s. Ulam was studying the growth of crystals and von Neumann was imagining a
      world of self-replicating robots. That’s right, robots that build copies of themselves. Once
      we see some examples of CA visualized, it’ll be clear how one might imagine modeling crystal
      growth; the robots idea is perhaps less obvious. Consider the design of a robot as a pattern
      on a grid of cells (think of filling in some squares on a piece of graph paper). Now consider
      a set of simple rules that would allow that pattern to create copies of itself on that grid.
      This is essentially the process of a CA that exhibits behavior similar to biological
      reproduction and evolution. (Incidentally, von Neumann’s cells had twenty-nine possible
      states.) Von Neumann’s work in self-replication and CA is conceptually similar to what is
      probably the most famous cellular automaton: the “Game of Life,” which we will discuss in
      detail in section 7.6.</p>

    <p>Perhaps the most significant scientific (and lengthy) work studying cellular automata arrived
      in 2002: Stephen Wolfram’s 1,280-page <a
        href="http://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/toc.html"><em>A New Kind of Science</em></a>.
      Available in its entirety for free online, Wolfram’s book discusses how CA are not simply neat
      tricks, but are relevant to the study of biology, chemistry, physics, and all branches of
      science. This chapter will barely scratch the surface of the theories Wolfram outlines (we
      will focus on the code implementation) so if the examples provided spark your curiosity,
      you’ll find plenty more to read about in his book.</p>

    <h2>7.2 Elementary Cellular Automata</h2>

    <a data-primary="cellular automaton (automata)" data-secondary="elementary"
      data-type="indexterm"></a> <a data-primary="cellular automaton (automata)"
      data-secondary="Wolfram algorithm for" data-type="indexterm"></a> <a

      data-primary="Wolfram" data-secondary="Stephen"
      data-tertiary="elementary cellular automata algorithm" data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p>The examples in this chapter will begin with a simulation of Wolfram’s work. To understand
      Wolfram’s elementary CA, we should ask ourselves the question: “What is the simplest cellular
      automaton we can imagine?” What’s exciting about this question and its answer is that even
      with the simplest CA imaginable, we will see the properties of complex systems at work.</p>

    <p>Let’s build Wolfram’s elementary CA from scratch. Concepts first, then code. What are the
      three key elements of a CA?</p>

    <p>1) <strong><em>Grid</em></strong>. The simplest grid would be one-dimensional: a line of
      cells.</p>

    <figure id="chapter07_figure2"><img alt="Figure 7.2" src="chapter07/ch07_02.png" />
      <figcaption>Figure 7.2</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>2) <strong><em>States</em></strong>. The simplest set of states (beyond having only one
      state) would be two states: 0 or 1.</p>

    <figure id="chapter07_figure3"><img alt="Figure 7.3" src="chapter07/ch07_03.png" />
      <figcaption>Figure 7.3</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <a data-primary="neighborhood (cellular automata)" data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p>3) <strong><em>Neighborhood</em></strong>. The simplest neighborhood in one dimension for any
      given cell would be the cell itself and its two adjacent neighbors: one to the left and one to
      the right.</p>

    <figure id="chapter07_figure4"><img alt="Figure 7.4: A neighborhood is three cells."
        src="chapter07/ch07_04.png" />
      <figcaption>Figure 7.4: A neighborhood is three cells.&nbsp;</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>So we begin with a line of cells, each with an initial state (let’s say it is random), and
      each with two neighbors. We’ll have to figure out what we want to do with the cells on the
      edges (since those have only one neighbor each), but this is something we can sort out later.
    </p>

    <figure id="chapter07_figure5"><img
        alt="Figure 7.5: The edge cell only has a neighborhood of two."
        src="chapter07/ch07_05.png" />
      <figcaption>Figure 7.5: The edge cell only has a neighborhood of two.&nbsp;</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <a data-primary="cellular automaton (automata)" data-secondary="time and"
      data-type="indexterm"></a> <a data-primary="time" data-secondary="cellular automata and"
      data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p>We haven’t yet discussed, however, what is perhaps the most important detail of how cellular
      automata work—<em>time</em>. We’re not really talking about real-world time here, but about
      the CA living over a period of <em>time</em>, which could also be called a
      <strong><em>generation</em></strong> and, in our case, will likely refer to the
      <strong><em>frame count</em></strong> of an animation. The figures above show us the CA at
      time equals 0 or generation 0. The questions we have to ask ourselves are: <em>How do we
        compute the states for all cells at generation 1? And generation 2?</em> And so on and so
      forth.</p>

    <figure id="chapter07_figure6"><img alt="Figure 7.6" src="chapter07/ch07_06.png" />
      <figcaption>Figure 7.6</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Let’s say we have an individual cell in the CA, and let’s call it CELL. The formula for
      calculating CELL’s state at any given time <code>t</code> is as follows:</p>

    <p><span class="formula">CELL state at time t = f(CELL neighborhood at time t - 1)</span></p>

    <p>In other words, a cell’s new state is a function of all the states in the cell’s neighborhood
      at the previous moment in time (or during the previous generation). We calculate a new state
      value by looking at all the previous neighbor states.</p>

    <figure id="chapter07_figure7"><img alt="Figure 7.7" src="chapter07/ch07_07.png" />
      <figcaption>Figure 7.7</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Now, in the world of cellular automata, there are many ways we could compute a cell’s state
      from a group of cells. Consider blurring an image. (Guess what? Image processing works with
      CA-like rules.) A pixel’s new state (i.e. its color) is the average of all of its neighbors’
      colors. We could also say that a cell’s new state is the sum of all of its neighbors’ states.
      With Wolfram’s elementary CA, however, we can actually do something a bit simpler and
      seemingly absurd: We can look at all the possible configurations of a cell and its neighbor
      and define the state outcome for every possible configuration. It seems ridiculous—wouldn’t
      there be way too many possibilities for this to be practical? Let’s give it a try.</p>

    <p>We have three cells, each with a state of 0 or 1. How many possible ways can we configure the
      states? If you love binary, you’ll notice that three cells define a 3-bit number, and how high
      can you count with 3 bits? Up to 8. Let’s have a look.</p>

    <figure id="chapter07_figure8"><img alt="Figure 7.8" src="chapter07/ch07_08.png" />
      <figcaption>Figure 7.8</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Once we have defined all the possible neighborhoods, we need to define an outcome (new state
      value: 0 or 1) for each neighborhood configuration.</p>

    <figure id="chapter07_figure9"><img alt="Figure 7.9" src="chapter07/ch07_09.png" />
      <figcaption>Figure 7.9</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>The standard Wolfram model is to start generation 0 with all cells having a state of 0 except
      for the middle cell, which should have a state of 1.</p>

    <figure id="chapter07_figure10"><img alt="Figure 7.10" src="chapter07/ch07_10.png" />
      <figcaption>Figure 7.10</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Referring to the ruleset above, let’s see how a given cell (we’ll pick the center one) would
      change from generation 0 to generation 1.</p>

    <figure id="chapter07_figure11"><img alt="Figure 7.11" src="chapter07/ch07_11.png" />
      <figcaption>Figure 7.11</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Try applying the same logic to all of the cells above and fill in the empty cells.</p>

    <p>Now, let’s go past just one generation and color the cells —0 means white, 1 means black—and
      stack the generations, with each new generation appearing below the previous one.</p>

    <figure class="screenshot" id="chapter07_figure12"><img alt="Figure 7.12: Rule 90"
        src="chapter07/ch07_12.png" />
      <figcaption>Figure 7.12: Rule 90&nbsp;</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <a data-primary="cellular automaton (automata)" data-secondary="Sierpiński triangle"

      data-primary="Sierpiński" data-secondary="Wacław" data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p>The low-resolution shape we’re seeing above is the “Sierpiński triangle.” Named after the
      Polish mathematician Wacław Sierpiński, it’s a fractal pattern that we’ll examine in the next
      chapter. That’s right: this incredibly simple system of 0s and 1s, with little neighborhoods
      of three cells, can generate a shape as sophisticated and detailed as the Sierpiński triangle.
      Let’s look at it again, only with each cell a single pixel wide so that the resolution is much
      higher.</p>

    <figure class="screenshot" id="chapter07_figure13"><img alt="Figure 7.13: Rule 90"
        src="chapter07/ch07_13.png" />
      <figcaption>Figure 7.13: Rule 90&nbsp;</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>This particular result didn’t happen by accident. I picked this set of rules because of the
      pattern it generates. Take a look at Figure 7.8 one more time. Notice how there are eight
      possible neighborhood configurations; we therefore define a “ruleset” as a list of 8 bits.</p>

    <p>So this particular rule can be illustrated as follows:</p>

    <figure id="chapter07_figure14"><img alt="Figure 7.14: Rule 90" src="chapter07/ch07_14.png" />
      <figcaption>Figure 7.14: Rule 90&nbsp;</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Eight 0s and 1s means an 8-bit number. How many combinations of eight 0s and 1s are there?
      256. This is just like how we define the components of an RGB color. We get 8 bits for red,
      green, and blue, meaning we make colors with values from 0 to 255 (256 possibilities).</p>

    <p>In terms of a Wolfram elementary CA, we have now discovered that there are 256 possible
      rulesets. The above ruleset is commonly referred to as “Rule 90” because if you convert the
      binary sequence—01011010—to a decimal number, you’ll get the integer 90. Let’s try looking at
      the results of another ruleset.</p>

    <figure class="screenshot" id="chapter07_figure15"><img alt="Figure 7.15: Rule 222"
        src="chapter07/ch07_15.png" />
      <figcaption>Figure 7.15: Rule 222&nbsp;</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <figure class="half-width-right" id="chapter07_figure16"><img
        alt="Figure 7.16: A Textile Cone Snail (Conus textile), Cod Hole, Great Barrier Reef, Australia, 7 August 2005. Photographer: Richard Ling richard@research.canon.com.au"

      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>As we can now see, the simple act of creating a CA and defining a ruleset does not guarantee
      visually interesting results. Out of all 256 rulesets, only a handful produce compelling
      outcomes. However, it’s quite incredible that even one of these rulesets for a one-dimensional
      CA with only two possible states can produce the patterns we see every day in nature (see
      Figure 7.16), and it demonstrates how valuable these systems can be in simulation and pattern
      generation.</p>

    <p>Before we go too far down the road of how Wolfram classifies the results of varying rulesets,
      let’s look at how we actually build a p5.js sketch that generates the Wolfram CA and
      visualizes it onscreen.</p>

    <h2>7.3 How to Program an Elementary CA</h2>

    <a data-primary="cellular automaton (automata)" data-secondary="elementary"
      data-tertiary="implementing" data-type="indexterm"></a> <a
      data-primary="elementary cellular automata" data-secondary="implementing"
      data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p>You may be thinking: “OK, I’ve got this cell thing. And the cell thing has some properties,
      like a state, what generation it’s on, who its neighbors are, where it lives pixel-wise on the
      screen. And maybe it has some functions: it can display itself, it can generate its new state,
      etc.” This line of thinking is an excellent one and would likely lead you to write some code
      like this:</p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
class Cell {

}</pre>

    <p>This line of thinking, however, is not the road we will first travel. Later in this chapter,
      we will discuss why an object-oriented approach could prove valuable in developing a CA
      simulation, but to begin, we can work with a more elementary data structure. After all, what
      is an elementary CA but a list of 0s and 1s? Certainly, we could describe the following CA
      generation using an array:</p>

    <figure id="chapter07_figure17"><img alt="Figure 7.17" src="chapter07/ch07_17.png" />
      <figcaption>Figure 7.17</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
let cells = [1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0];</pre>

    <p>To draw that array, we simply check if we’ve got a 0 or a 1 and create a fill accordingly.
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
//{!1} Loop through every cell.
for (let i = 0; i < cells.length; i++) {
	//{!5} Create a fill based on its state (0 or 1).
  if (cells[i] == 0) {
		fill(255);
	} else {
		fill(0);
	}
  stroke(0);
  rect(i*50, 0, 50, 50);
}</pre>

    <p>Now that we have the array to describe the cell states of a given generation (which we’ll
      ultimately consider the “current” generation), we need a mechanism by which to compute the
      next generation. Let’s think about the pseudocode of what we are doing at the moment.</p>

    <p><strong>For every cell in the array:</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong><em>Take a look at the neighborhood states: left, middle, right.</em></strong>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong><em>Look up the new value for the cell state according to some
              ruleset.</em></strong></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong><em>Set the cell’s state to that new value.</em></strong></p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>This may lead you to write some code like this:</p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
// For every cell in the array...
for (let i = 0; i < cells.length; i++) {

  //{!3} ...take a look at the neighborhood.
  let left   = cells[i-1];
  let middle = cells[i];
  let right  = cells[i+1];

  //{!1} Look up the new value according to the rules.
  let newstate = rules(left,middle,right);

  //{!1} Set the cell’s state to the new value.
  cells[i] = newstate;
}</pre>

    <p>We’re fairly close to getting this right, but we’ve made one minor blunder and one major
      blunder in the above code. Let’s talk about what we’ve done well so far.</p>

    <p>Notice how easy it is to look at a cell’s neighbors. Because an array is an ordered list of
      data, we can use the fact that the indices are numbered to know which cells are next to which
      cells. We know that cell number 15, for example, has cell 14 to its left and 16 to its right.
      More generally, we can say that for any cell <code>i</code>, its neighbors are
      <code>i-1</code> and <code>i+1</code>.</p>

    <a data-primary="elementary cellular automata" data-secondary="edge cases and"
      data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p>We’re also farming out the calculation of a new state value to some function called
      <code>rules()</code>. Obviously, we’re going to have to write this function ourselves, but the
      point we’re making here is modularity. We have a basic framework for the CA in this function,
      and if we later want to change how the rules operate, we don’t have to touch that framework;
      we can simply rewrite the <code>rules()</code> function to compute the new states differently.
    </p>

    <p>So what have we done wrong? Let’s talk through how the code will execute. First, we look at
      cell index <code>i</code> equals 0. Now let’s look at 0’s neighbors. Left is index -1. Middle
      is index 0. And right is index 1. However, our array by definition does not have an element
      with the index -1. It starts with 0. This is a problem we’ve alluded to before: the edge
      cases.</p>

    <p>How do we deal with the cells on the edge who don’t have a neighbor to both their left and
      their right? Here are three possible solutions to this problem:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p><strong><em>Edges remain constant.</em></strong> This is perhaps the simplest solution.
          We never bother to evaluate the edges and always leave their state value constant (0 or
          1).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong><em>Edges wrap around.</em></strong> Think of the CA as a strip of paper and turn
          that strip of paper into a ring. The cell on the left edge is a neighbor of the cell on
          the right and vice versa. This can create the appearance of an infinite grid and is
          probably the most used solution.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong><em>Edges have different neighborhoods and rules.</em></strong> If we wanted to,
          we could treat the edge cells differently and create rules for cells that have a
          neighborhood of two instead of three. You may want to do this in some circumstances, but
          in our case, it’s going to be a lot of extra lines of code for little benefit.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>To make the code easiest to read and understand right now, we’ll go with option #1 and just
      skip the edge cases, leaving their values constant. This can be accomplished by starting the
      loop one cell later and ending one cell earlier:</p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
//{.bold} A loop that ignores the first and last cell
for (let i = 1; i < cells.length-1; i++) {
  let left   = cells[i-1];
  let middle = cells[i];
  let right  = cells[i+1];
  let newstate = rules(left, middle, right);
  cells[i] = newstate;
}</pre>

    <a data-primary="elementary cellular automata" data-secondary="generations"
      data-tertiary="maintaining integrity of" data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p>There’s one more problem we have to fix before we’re done. It’s subtle and you won’t get a
      compilation error; the CA just won’t perform correctly. However, identifying this problem is
      absolutely fundamental to the techniques behind programming CA simulations. It all lies in
      this line of code:</p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
  cells[i] = newstate;</pre>

    <p>This seems like a perfectly innocent line. After all, we’ve computed the new state value and
      we’re simply giving the cell its new state. But in the next iteration, you’ll discover a
      massive bug. Let’s say we’ve just computed the new state for cell #5. What do we do next? We
      calculate the new state value for cell #6.</p>

    <p><em>Cell #6, generation 0 = some state, 0 or 1</em><br />
      <em>Cell #6, generation 1 = a function of states for <strong>cell #5</strong>, cell #6, and
        cell #7 at *generation 0*</em></p>

    <p>Notice how we need the value of cell #5 at generation 0 in order to calculate cell #6’s new
      state at generation 1? A cell’s new state is a function of the previous neighbor states. Do we
      know cell #5’s value at generation 0? Remember, p5.js just executes this line of code for
      <em>i = 5</em>.</p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
  cells[i] = newstate;</pre>

    <p>Once this happens, we no longer have access to cell #5’s state at generation 0, and cell
      index 5 is storing the value for generation 1. We cannot overwrite the values in the array
      while we are processing the array, because we need those values to calculate the new values. A
      solution to this problem is to have two arrays, one to store the current generation states and
      one for the next generation states.</p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
//{!1 .bold} Another array to store the states
// for the next generation.
let newcells = [];

for (let i = 1; i < cells.length-1; i++) {
  //{!3} Look at the states from the current array.
  const left   = cells[i-1];
  const middle = cells[i];
  const right  = cells[i+1];
  const newstate = rules(left, middle, right);
  //{!1 .bold} Saving the new state in the new array
  newcells[i] = newstate;
}</pre>

    <p>Once the entire array of values is processed, we can then discard the old array and set it
      equal to the new array of states.</p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
//{.bold} The new generation becomes the current generation.
cells = newcells;</pre>

    <p>We’re almost done. The above code is complete except for the fact that we haven’t yet written
      the <code>rules()</code> function that computes the new state value based on the neighborhood
      (left, middle, and right cells). We know that function needs to return an integer (0 or 1) as
      well as receive three arguments (for the three neighbors).</p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
  //{!1} Function receives 3 ints and returns 1.
  function rules (a, b, c) {</pre>

    <p>Now, there are many ways we could write this function, but I’d like to start with a
      long-winded one that will hopefully provide a clear illustration of what we are doing.</p>

    <a data-primary="cellular automaton (automata)" data-secondary="rulesets"
      data-tertiary="defining" data-type="indexterm"></a> <a
      data-primary="rulesets for cellular automata" data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p>Let’s first establish how we are storing the ruleset. The ruleset, if you remember from the
      previous section, is a series of 8 bits (0 or 1) that defines that outcome for every possible
      neighborhood configuration.</p>

    <figure id="chapter07_figure14"><img alt="Figure 7.14 (repeated)" src="chapter07/ch07_14.png" />
      <figcaption>Figure 7.14 (repeated)&nbsp;</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>We can store this ruleset in p5.js as an array.</p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
let ruleset = [0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0];</pre>

    <p>And then say:</p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
if (a == 1 && b == 1 && c == 1) return ruleset[0];</pre>

    <p>If left, middle, and right all have the state 1, then that matches the configuration 111 and
      the new state should be equal to the first value in the ruleset array. We can now duplicate
      this strategy for all eight possibilities.</p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
  function rules (a, b, c) {
    if      (a === 1 && b === 1 && c === 1) return ruleset[0];
    else if (a === 1 && b === 1 && c === 0) return ruleset[1];
    else if (a === 1 && b === 0 && c === 1) return ruleset[2];
    else if (a === 1 && b === 0 && c === 0) return ruleset[3];
    else if (a === 0 && b === 1 && c === 1) return ruleset[4];
    else if (a === 0 && b === 1 && c === 0) return ruleset[5];
    else if (a === 0 && b === 0 && c === 1) return ruleset[6];
    else if (a === 0 && b === 0 && c === 0) return ruleset[7];
    //{!1} For this function to be valid, we have to make sure something is returned
    // in cases where the states do not match one of the eight possibilities.
    // We know this is impossible given the rest of our code, but p5.js (javascript) does not.
    return 0;
  }</pre>

    <p>I like having the example written as above because it describes line by line exactly what is
      happening for each neighborhood configuration. However, it’s not a great solution. After all,
      what if we design a CA that has 4 possible states (0-3) and suddenly we have 64 possible
      neighborhood configurations? With 10 possible states, we have 1,000 configurations. Certainly
      we don’t want to type in 1,000 lines of code!</p>

    <p>Another solution, though perhaps a bit more difficult to follow, is to convert the
      neighborhood configuration (a 3-bit number) into a regular integer and use that value as the
      index into the ruleset array. This can be done in Java like so.</p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
  function rules (a, b, c) {
    // A quick way to join three bits into a String
    let s = "" + a + b + c;

    // The second argument ‘2’ indicates that we intend to
    // parse a binary number (base 2).
    let index = parseInt(s,2);

    return ruleset[index];
  }</pre>

    <p>There’s one tiny problem with this solution, however. Let’s say we are implementing rule 222:
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
// Rule 222
let ruleset = [1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0];</pre>

    <p>And we have the neighborhood “111”. The resulting state is equal to ruleset index 0, as we
      see in the first way we wrote the function.</p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
    if (a === 1 && b === 1 && c === 1) return ruleset[0];</pre>

    <p>If we convert “111” to a decimal number, we get 7. But we don’t want ruleset[7]; we want
      ruleset[0]. For this to work, we need to write the ruleset with the bits in reverse order,
      i.e.</p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
//{!1} Rule 222 in “reverse” order
let ruleset = [0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1];</pre>

    <p>So far in this section, we’ve written everything we need to compute the generations for a
      Wolfram elementary CA. Let’s take a moment to organize the above code into a class, which will
      ultimately help in the design of our overall sketch.</p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
class CA {
  constructor(){
    //{!2} We need an array for the cells and
    // one for the rules.

    this.cells = [];
    //{!1} Arbitrarily starting with rule 90
    this.ruleset = [0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0];

    for (let i = 0; i < width; i++) {
      this.cells[i] = 0;
    }
    //{!1} All cells start with state 0, except the center
    // cell has state 1.
    this.cells[this.cells.length/2] = 1;
  }

  generate() {
    //{!7} Compute the next generation.
    let nextgen = [];
    for (let i = 1; i < this.cells.length-1; i++) {
      let left   = this.cells[i-1];
      let me     = this.cells[i];
      let right  = this.cells[i+1];
      this.nextgen[i] = this.rules(left, me, right);
    }
    this.cells = this.nextgen;
  }

    <h2>7.4 Drawing an Elementary CA</h2>

    <a data-primary="elementary cellular automata" data-secondary="drawing"
      data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p>What’s missing? Presumably, it’s our intention to display cells and their states in visual
      form. As we saw earlier, the standard technique for doing this is to stack the generations one
      on top of each other and draw a rectangle that is black (for state 1) or white (for state 0).
    </p>

    <figure class="screenshot" id="chapter07_figure12"><img alt="Figure 7.12 (repeated)"
        src="chapter07/ch07_12.png" />
      <figcaption>Figure 7.12 (repeated)&nbsp;</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Before we implement this particular visualization, I’d like to point out two things.</p>

    <p>One, this visual interpretation of the data is completely literal. It’s useful for
      demonstrating the algorithms and results of Wolfram’s elementary CA, but it shouldn’t
      necessarily drive your own personal work. It’s rather unlikely that you are building a project
      that needs precisely this algorithm with this visual style. So while learning to draw the CA
      in this way will help you understand and implement CA systems, this skill should exist only as
      a foundation.</p>

    <p>Second, the fact that we are visualizing a one-dimensional CA with a two-dimensional image
      can be confusing. It’s very important to remember that this is not a 2D CA. We are simply
      choosing to show a history of all the generations stacked vertically. This technique creates a
      two-dimensional image out of many instances of one-dimensional data. But the system itself is
      one-dimensional. Later, we are going to look at an actual 2D CA (the Game of Life) and discuss
      how we might choose to display such a system.</p>

    <p>The good news is that drawing the CA is not particularly difficult. Let’s begin by looking at
      how we would render a single generation. Assume we have a canvas 600 pixels wide
      and we want each cell to be a 10x10 square. We therefore have a CA with 60 cells. Of course,
      we can calculate this value dynamically.</p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
let w = 10;
//{!1} How many cells fit across given a certain width
let cells = [];</pre>

    <p>Assuming we’ve gone through the process of generating the cell states (which we did in the
      previous section), we can now loop through the entire array of cells, drawing a black cell
      when the state is 1 and a white one when the state is 0.</p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
for (let i = 0; i < width/w; i++) {
  //{!2} Black or white fill?
  if (cells[i] == 1) fill(0);
  else               fill(255);
  //{!1} Notice how the x-position is the cell index times the cell width.
  // In the above scenario, this would give us cells located at x equals 0, 10, 20, 30, all the way up to 600.
  rect(i*this.w, 0, this.w, this.w);
}</pre>

    <p>In truth, we could optimize the above by having a white background and only drawing when
      there is a black cell (saving us the work of drawing many white squares), but in most cases
      this solution is good enough (and necessary for other more sophisticated designs with varying
      colors, etc.) Also, if we wanted each cell to be represented as a single pixel, we would not
      want to use p5.js’s <code>rect()</code> function, but rather access the pixel array
      directly.</p>

    <p>In the above code, you’ll notice the y-position for each rectangle is 0. If we want the
      generations to be drawn next to each other, with each row of cells marking a new generation,
      we’ll also need to compute a y-position based on how many iterations of the CA we’ve executed.
      We could accomplish this by adding a “generation” variable (an integer) to our CA class and
      incrementing it each time through <code>generate()</code>. With these additions, we can now
      look at the CA class with all the features for both computing and drawing the CA.</p>

    <p>Before we move on to looking at CA in two dimensions, it’s worth taking a brief look at
      Wolfram’s classification for cellular automata. As we noted earlier, the vast majority of
      elementary CA rulesets produce uninspiring results, while some result in wondrously complex
      patterns like those found in nature. Wolfram has divided up the range of outcomes into four
      classes:</p>

    <figure class="screenshot" data-p5-sketch="https://editor.p5js.org/embed/B1q_unNwQ"

      data-primary="Wolfram classification" data-secondary="Uniformity class"
      data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p><strong><em>Class 1: Uniformity.</em></strong> Class 1 CAs end up, after some number of
      generations, with every cell constant. This is not terribly exciting to watch. Rule 222
      (above) is a class 1 CA; if you run it for enough generations, every cell will eventually
      become and remain black.</p>

    <figure class="screenshot" data-p5-sketch="https://editor.p5js.org/embed/HyFGfAHv7"

    <p><strong><em>Class 2: Repetition.</em></strong> Like class 1 CAs, class 2 CAs remain stable,
      but the cell states are not constant. Rather, they oscillate in some repeating pattern of 0s
      and 1s. In rule 190 (above), each cell follows the sequence 11101110111011101110.</p>

      discernible pattern. In fact, rule 30 (above) is used as a random number generator in
      Wolfram’s Mathematica software. Again, this is a moment where we can feel amazed that such a
      simple system with simple rules can descend into a chaotic and random pattern.</p>

      class 2 and class 3. One can find repetitive, oscillating patterns inside the CA, but where
      and when these patterns appear is unpredictable and seemingly random. Class 4 CAs exhibit the
      properties of complex systems that we described earlier in this chapter and in Chapter 6. If a
      class 3 CA wowed you, then a class 4 like Rule 110 above should really blow your mind.</p>

    <p>In 1970, Martin Gardner wrote an article in <em>Scientific American</em> that documented
      mathematician John Conway’s new “Game of Life,” describing it as “recreational” mathematics
      and suggesting that the reader get out a chessboard and some checkers and “play.” While the
      Game of Life has become something of a computational cliché (make note of the myriad projects
      that display the Game of Life on LEDs, screens, projection surfaces, etc.), it is still
      important for us to build it from scratch. For one, it provides a good opportunity to practice
      our skills with two-dimensional arrays, object orientation, etc. But perhaps more importantly,
      its core principles are tied directly to our core goals—simulating the natural world with
      code. Though we may want to avoid simply duplicating it without a great deal of thought or
      care, the algorithm and its technical implementation will provide us with the inspiration and
      foundation to build simulations that exhibit the characteristics and behaviors of biological
      systems of reproduction.</p>

    <p>Unlike von Neumann, who created an extraordinarily complex system of states and rules, Conway
      wanted to achieve a similar “lifelike” result with the simplest set of rules possible. Martin
      Gardner outlined Conway’s goals as follows:</p>

    <blockquote>“1. There should be no initial pattern for which there is a simple proof that the
      population can grow without limit. 2. There should be initial patterns that apparently do grow
      without limit. 3. There should be simple initial patterns that grow and change for a
      considerable period of time before coming to an end in three possible ways: fading away
      completely (from overcrowding or becoming too sparse), settling into a stable configuration
      that remains unchanged thereafter, or entering an oscillating phase in which they repeat an
      endless cycle of two or more periods.” <span class="attribution"> —Martin Gardner, <span
          style="font-style:normal"><a
            href="http://www.ibiblio.org/lifepatterns/october1970.html">Scientific
            American</a></span> 223 (October 1970): 120-123. </span></blockquote>

    <p>The above might sound a bit cryptic, but it essentially describes a Wolfram class 4 CA. The
      CA should be patterned but unpredictable over time, eventually settling into a uniform or
      oscillating state. In other words, though Conway didn’t use this terminology, it should have
      all those properties of a <em>complex system</em> that we keep mentioning.</p>

    <p>Let’s look at how the Game of Life works. It won’t take up too much time or space, since
      we’ve covered the basics of CA already.</p>

    <figure class="half-width-right" id="chapter07_figure22"><img alt="Figure 7.22"
        src="chapter07/ch07_22.png" />
      <figcaption>Figure 7.22</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>First, instead of a line of cells, we now have a two-dimensional matrix of cells. As with the
      elementary CA, the possible states are 0 or 1. Only in this case, since we’re talking about
      “life," 0 means dead and 1 means alive.</p>

    <p>The cell’s neighborhood has also expanded. If a neighbor is an adjacent cell, a neighborhood
      is now nine cells instead of three.</p>

    <p>With three cells, we had a 3-bit number or eight possible configurations. With nine cells, we
      have 9 bits, or 512 possible neighborhoods. In most cases, it would be impractical to define
      an outcome for every single possibility. The Game of Life gets around this problem by defining
      a set of rules according to general characteristics of the neighborhood. In other words, is
      the neighborhood overpopulated with life? Surrounded by death? Or just right? Here are the
      rules of life.</p>

    <a data-primary="Game of Life" data-secondary="rules of" data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p><strong><em>Death.</em></strong> If a cell is alive (state = 1) it will die (state
          becomes 0) under the following circumstances.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><strong><em>Overpopulation:</em></strong> If the cell has four or more alive
              neighbors, it dies.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong><em>Loneliness:</em></strong> If the cell has one or fewer alive neighbors,
              it dies.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong><em>Birth.</em></strong> If a cell is dead (state = 0) it will come to life
          (state becomes 1) if it has exactly three alive neighbors (no more, no less).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong><em>Stasis.</em></strong> In all other cases, the cell state does not change. To
          be thorough, let’s describe those scenarios.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><strong><em>Staying Alive:</em></strong> If a cell is alive and has exactly two or
              three live neighbors, it stays alive.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong><em>Staying Dead:</em></strong> If a cell is dead and has anything other than
              three live neighbors, it stays dead.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Let’s look at a few examples, focussing on the center cell.</p>

    <figure id="chapter07_figure23"><img alt="Figure 7.23" src="chapter07/ch07_23.png" />
      <figcaption>Figure 7.23</figcaption>

    <a data-primary="Game of Life" data-secondary="drawing" data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p>With the elementary CA, we were able to look at all the generations next to each other,
      stacked as rows in a 2D grid. With the Game of Life, however, the CA itself is in two
      dimensions. We could try creating an elaborate 3D visualization of the results and stack all
      the generations in a cube structure (and in fact, you might want to try this as an exercise).
      Nevertheless, the typical way the Game of Life is displayed is to treat each generation as a
      single frame in an animation. So instead of viewing all the generations at once, we see them
      one at a time, and the result resembles rapidly growing bacteria in a Petri dish.</p>

    <p>One of the exciting aspects of the Game of Life is that there are initial patterns that yield
      intriguing results. For example, some remain static and never change.</p>

    <figure id="chapter07_figure24"><img alt="Figure 7.24" src="chapter07/ch07_24.png" />
      <figcaption>Figure 7.24</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>There are patterns that oscillate back and forth between two states.</p>

    <figure id="chapter07_figure25"><img alt="Figure 7.25" src="chapter07/ch07_25.png" />
      <figcaption>Figure 7.25</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>And there are also patterns that from generation to generation move about the grid. (It’s
      important to note that the cells themselves aren’t actually moving, although we see the
      appearance of motion in the result as the cells turn on and off.)</p>

    <figure id="chapter07_figure26"><img alt="Figure 7.26" src="chapter07/ch07_26.png" />
      <figcaption>Figure 7.26</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>If you are interested in these patterns, there are several good “out of the box” Game of Life
      demonstrations online that allow you to configure the CA’s initial state and watch it run at
      varying speeds. Two examples you might want to examine are:</p>

    <h2>7.7 Programming the Game of Life</h2>

    <a data-primary="two-dimensional cellular automata" data-secondary="implementing"
      data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p>Now we just need to extend our code from the Wolfram CA to two dimensions. We used a
      one-dimensional array to store the list of cell states before, and for the Game of Life, we
      can use a <a href="http://www.processing.org/learning/2darray/">two-dimensional array</a>.</p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
let w = 8;
let columns = width/w;
let rows = height/w;
let board = [];</pre>

    <p>We’ll begin by initializing each cell of the board with a random state: 0 or 1.</p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
for (let x = 0; x < columns; x++) {
  for (let y = 0; y < rows; y++) {
    //{!1} Initialize each cell with a 0 or 1.
    board[x][y] = int(random(2));
  }
}</pre>

    <p>And to compute the next generation, just as before, we need a fresh 2D array to write to as
      we analyze each cell’s neighborhood and calculate a new state.</p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
let next = [];

for (let x = 0; x < columns; x++) {
  for (let y = 0; y < rows; y++) {

    //{!1} We need a new state for each cell.
    next[x][y] = _______________?;

  }
}</pre>

    <figure class="half-width-right" id="chapter07_figure27"><img alt="Figure 7.27"
        src="chapter07/ch07_27.png" />
      <figcaption>Figure 7.27</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>OK. Before we can sort out how to actually calculate the new state, we need to know how we
      can reference each cell’s neighbor. In the case of the 1D CA, this was simple: if a cell index
      was <code>i</code>, its neighbors were i-1 and i+1. Here each cell doesn’t have a single
      index, but rather a column and row index: x,y. As shown in Figure 7.27, we can see that its
      neighbors are: <em>(x-1,y-1) (x,y-1), (x+1,y-2), (x-1,y), (x+1,y), (x-1,y+1), (x,y+1),</em>
      and <em>(x+1,y+1)</em>.</p>

    <p>All of the Game of Life rules operate by knowing how many neighbors are alive. So if we
      create a neighbor counter variable and increment it each time we find a neighbor with a state
      of 1, we’ll have the total of live neighbors.</p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
let neighbors = 0;

// Top row of neighbors
if (board[x-1][y-1] == 1) neighbors++;
if (board[x  ][y-1] == 1) neighbors++;
if (board[x+1][y-1] == 1) neighbors++;

// Middle row of neighbors
// (note we don’t count self)
if (board[x-1][y]   == 1) neighbors++;
if (board[x+1][y]   == 1) neighbors++;

// Bottom row of neighbors
if (board[x-1][y+1] == 1) neighbors++;
if (board[x  ][y+1] == 1) neighbors++;
if (board[x+1][y+1] == 1) neighbors++;</pre>

    <p>And again, just as with the Wolfram CA, we find ourselves in a situation where the above is a
      useful and clear way to write the code for teaching purposes, allowing us to see every step
      (each time we find a neighbor with a state of one, we increase a counter). Nevertheless, it’s
      a bit silly to say, “If the cell state equals one, add one to a counter” when we could just
      say, “Add the cell state to a counter.” After all, if the state is only a 0 or 1, the sum of
      all the neighbors’ states will yield the total number of live cells. Since the neighbors are
      arranged in a mini 3x3 grid, we can add them all up with another loop.</p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
for (let i = -1; i <= 1; i++) {
  for (let j = -1; j <= 1; j++) {
    //{!1} Add up all the neighbors’ states.
    neighbors += board[x+i][y+j];
  }
}</pre>

    <p>Of course, we’ve made a mistake in the code above. In the Game of Life, the cell itself does
      not count as one of the neighbors. We could use a conditional to skip adding the state when
      both <code>i</code> and <code>j</code> equal 0, but another option would be to just subtract
      the cell state once we’ve finished the loop.</p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
// Whoops! Subtract the cell’s state,
// which we don’t want in the total.
neighbors -= board[x][y];</pre>

    <p>Finally, once we know the total number of live neighbors, we can decide what the cell’s new
      state should be according to the rules: birth, death, or stasis.</p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
// {.code-wide} If it is alive and has less than 2 live neighbors, it dies from loneliness.
if        ((board[x][y] == 1) && (neighbors < 2)) {
  next[x][y] = 0;
// {.code-wide} If it is alive and has more than 3 live neighbors, it dies from overpopulation.
} else if ((board[x][y] == 1) && (neighbors >  3)) {
  next[x][y] = 0;
// {.code-wide} If it is dead and has exactly 3 live neighbors, it is born!
} else if ((board[x][y] == 0) &&& (neighbors == 3)) {
  next[x][y] = 1;
// {.code-wide} In all other cases, its state remains the same.
} else {
  next[x][y] = board[x][y];
}</pre>

    <p>Putting this all together, we have:</p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
// The next board
let next = [];

//{!2} Looping but skipping the edge cells
for (let x = 1; x < columns-1; x++) {
  for (let y = 1; y < rows-1; y++) {
    // Add up all the neighbor states to
    // calculate the number of live neighbors.
    int neighbors = 0;
    for (let i = -1; i <= 1; i++) {
      for (let j = -1; j <= 1; j++) {
        neighbors += board[x+i][y+j];
      }
    }
    // Correct by subtracting the cell state itself.
    neighbors -= board[x][y];

    //{!4} The rules of life!
    if      ((board[x][y] == 1) && (neighbors <  2)) next[x][y] = 0;
    else if ((board[x][y] == 1) && (neighbors >  3)) next[x][y] = 0;
    else if ((board[x][y] == 0) && (neighbors == 3)) next[x][y] = 1;
    else next[x][y] = board[x][y];
  }
}

// The 2D array “next” is now the current board.
board = next;</pre>

    <p>Finally, once the next generation is calculated, we can employ the same method we used to
      draw the Wolfram CA—a square for each spot, white for off, black for on.</p>

        little for a p5.js application, but if you were implementing the Game of Life
        on a microcontroller or mobile device, you’d want to be more careful. One solution is to
        have only two arrays and constantly swap them, writing the next set of states into whichever
        one isn’t the current array. Implement this particular solution.</p>

    <h2>7.8 Object-Oriented Cells</h2>

    <a data-primary="object" data-secondary="cells in cellular automata as"
      data-type="indexterm"></a> <a data-primary="object-oriented programming"
      data-secondary="cellular automata and" data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p>Over the course of the previous six chapters, we’ve slowly built examples of systems of
      <em>objects</em> with properties that move about the screen. And in this chapter, although
      we’ve been talking about a “cell” as if it were an object, we actually haven’t been using any
      object orientation in our code (other than a class to describe the CA system as a whole). This
      has worked because a cell is such an enormously simple object (a single bit). However, in a
      moment, we are going to discuss some ideas for further developing CA systems, many of which
      involve keeping track of multiple properties for each cell. For example, what if a cell needed
      to remember its last ten states? Or what if we wanted to apply some of our motion and physics
      thinking to a CA and have the cells move about the window, dynamically changing their
      neighbors from frame to frame?</p>

    <p>To accomplish any of these ideas (and more), it would be helpful to see how we might treat a
      cell as an object with multiple properties, rather than as a single 0 or 1. To show this,
      let’s just recreate the Game of Life simulation. Only instead of:</p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
  let board;</pre>

    <p>Let’s have:</p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
  let board;</pre>

    <p>where <code>Cell</code> is a class we will write. What are the properties of a
      <code>Cell</code> object? In our Game of Life example, each cell has a position and size, as
      well as a state.</p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
class Cell {
  constructor(x, y, w){
    // position and size
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
    this.w = w;

    // What is the cell’s state?
    this.state = ????;

  }
  </pre>

    <p>In the non-OOP version, we used a separate 2D array to keep track of the states for the
      current and next generation. By making a cell an object, however, each cell could keep track
      of both states. In this case, we’ll think of the cell as remembering its previous state (for
      when new states need to be computed).</p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
  // What was its previous state?
  this.previous = this.state;</pre>

    <p>This allows us to visualize more information about what the state is doing. For example, we
      could choose to color a cell differently if its state has changed. For example:</p>

    <figure class="screenshot" data-p5-sketch="https://editor.p5js.org/embed/SyO0p3mux"><img
        alt="ch07 ex03" src="chapter07/ch07_ex03.png" />
      <figcaption>&nbsp;</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <div data-type="example">
      <h5>Example 7.3: Game of Life OOP</h5>
    </div>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
display() {
  //{!1} If the cell is born, color it blue!
  if (previous == 0 && this.state == 1) fill(0, 0, 255);
  else if (this.state == 1) fill(0);

  //{!1} If the cell dies, color it red!
  else if (this.previous == 1 && this.state == 0) fill(255, 0, 0);
  else fill(255);

  rect(this.x, this.y, this.w, this.w);
}</pre>

    <p>Not much else about the code (at least for our purposes here) has to change. The neighbors
      can still be counted the same way; the difference is that we now need to refer to the object’s
      state variables as we loop through the 2D array.</p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
for (let this.x = 1; x < this.columns-1; x++) {

        neighbors += this.board[this.x+i][this.y+j].previous;
      }
    }
    neighbors -= this.board[x][y].previous;

    //{!3} We are calling a function newState() to assign a new state to each cell.
    if      ((this.board[x][y].state == 1) && (neighbors <  2)) this.board[x][y].newState(0);
    else if ((this.board[x][y].state == 1) && (neighbors >  3)) this.board[x][y].newState(0);
    else if ((this.board[x][y].state == 0) && (neighbors == 3)) this.board[x][y].newState(1);
    // else do nothing!
  }

      data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p><strong><em>1) Non-rectangular Grids</em></strong>. There’s no particular reason why you
      should limit yourself to having your cells on a rectangular grid. What happens if you design a
      CA with another type of shape?</p>

    <div data-type="exercise" id="chapter07_exercise9">
      <h5>Exercise 7.9</h5>

      <p>Create a CA using a grid of hexagons (as below), each with six neighbors.</p>

      data-secondary="cellular automata based on" data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p><strong><em>2) Probabilistic</em></strong>. The rules of a CA don’t necessarily have to
      define an exact outcome.</p>

    <div data-type="exercise" id="chapter07_exercise10">
      <h5>Exercise 7.10</h5>

      <p>Rewrite the Game of Life rules as follows:</p>

      <p>Overpopulation: If the cell has four or more alive neighbors, it has a 80% chance of
        dying.<br />
        Loneliness: If the cell has one or fewer alive neighbors, it has a 60% chance of
        dying.<br />
        Etc.</p>

      data-type="indexterm"></a> <a data-primary="continuous (cellular automata)"
      data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p><strong><em>3) Continuous</em></strong>. We’ve looked at examples where the cell’s state can
      only be a 1 or a 0. But what if the cell’s state was a floating point number between 0 and 1?
    </p>

    <div data-type="exercise" id="chapter07_exercise11">
      <h5>Exercise 7.11</h5>

      <p>Adapt Wolfram elementary CA to have the state be a float. You could define rules such as,
        “If the state is greater than 0.5” or “…less than 0.2.”</p>

    <a data-primary="cellular automaton (automata)" data-secondary="image processing"
      data-type="indexterm"></a> <a data-primary="image processing (cellular automata)"
      data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p><strong><em>4) Image Processing</em></strong>. We briefly touched on this earlier, but many
      image-processing algorithms operate on CA-like rules. Blurring an image is creating a new
      pixel out of the average of a neighborhood of pixels. Simulations of ink dispersing on paper
      or water rippling over an image can be achieved with CA rules.</p>

    <div data-type="exercise" id="chapter07_exercise12">
      <h5>Exercise 7.12</h5>

      <p>Create a CA in which a pixel is a cell and a color is its state.</p>

    <a data-primary="cellular automaton (automata)" data-secondary="historical"
      data-type="indexterm"></a> <a data-primary="historical (cellular automata)"
      data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p><strong><em>5) Historical</em></strong>. In the Game of Life object-oriented example, we used
      two variables to keep track of its state: current and previous. What if you use an array to
      keep track of a cell’s state history? This relates to the idea of a “complex adaptive system,”
      one that has the ability to adapt and change its rules over time by learning from its history.
      We’ll see an example of this in Chapter 10: Neural Networks.</p>

    <div data-type="exercise" id="chapter07_exercise13">
      <h5>Exercise 7.13</h5>

      <p>Visualize the Game of Life by coloring each cell according to how long it’s been alive or
        dead. Can you also use the cell’s history to inform the rules?</p>
    </div>

      data-type="indexterm"></a> <a data-primary="moving cells (cellular automata)"
      data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p><strong><em>6) Moving cells</em></strong>. In these basic examples, cells have a fixed
      position on a grid, but you could build a CA with cells that have no fixed position and
      instead move about the screen.</p>

    <div data-type="exercise" id="chapter07_exercise14">
      <h5>Exercise 7.14</h5>

      <p>Use CA rules in a flocking system. What if each boid had a state (that perhaps informs its
        steering behaviors) and its neighborhood changed from frame to frame as it moved closer to
        or further from other boids?</p>

    <a data-primary="cellular automaton (automata)" data-secondary="nesting"
      data-type="indexterm"></a> <a data-primary="nesting (cellular automata)"
      data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p><strong><em>7) Nesting</em></strong>. Another feature of complex systems is that they can be
      nested. Our world tends to work this way: a city is a complex system of people, a person is a
      complex system of organs, an organ is a complex system of cells, and so on and so forth.</p>

    <div data-type="exercise" id="chapter07_exercise15">
      <h5>Exercise 7.15</h5>

      <p>Design a CA in which each cell itself is a smaller CA or a system of boids.</p>

      <p>Step 7 Exercise:</p>

      <p>Incorporate cellular automata into your ecosystem. Some possibilities:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Give each creature a state. How can that state drive their behavior? Taking inspiration
            from CA, how can that state change over time according to its neighbors’ states?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Consider the ecosystem’s world to be a CA. The creatures move from tile to tile. Each
            tile has a state—is it land? water? food?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Use a CA to generate a pattern for the design of a creature in your ecosystem.</p>
