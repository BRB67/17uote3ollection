### Sonnet 139
O call not me to justify the wrong,
That thy unkindness lays upon my heart,
Wound me not with thine eyes but with thy tongue,
Use power with power, and slay me not by art.
Tell me thou lov'st elsewhere; but in my sight,
Dear heart, forbear to glance thine eye aside.
What need'st thy wound with cunning, when thou might
Is more than my o'er-press'd defense can bide?
Let me excuse thee, ah my love well knows
Her pretty looks have been mine enemies;
And therefore from my face she turns my foes,
That they elsewhere might dart their injuries:
Yet do no so; but since I am near slain,
Kill me outright with looks and rid my pain.
