# Book Quotes:

THE aim of this book is to suggest to amateurs of all ages many things which they can
    profitably make of wood, and to start them in the way to work successfully. It is
    hoped that, in the case of boys, it may show them pleasant and useful ways to work
    off some of their surplus energy, and at the same time contribute toward their
    harmonious all-round development.
    
    It is not an attempt to teach the arts of architecture, carpentry, cabinet-making or
    boat building.
