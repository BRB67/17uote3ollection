# Book Quotes:

THE aim of this book is to suggest to amateurs of all ages many things which they can
    profitably make of wood, and to start them in the way to work successfully. It is
    hoped that, in the case of boys, it may show them pleasant and useful ways to work
    off some of their surplus energy, and at the same time contribute toward their
    harmonious all-round development.
    
    It is not an attempt to teach the arts of architecture, carpentry, cabinet-making or
    boat building. Although not intended primarily to impart skill in the use of tools
    (something which can only be acquired from experience and observation and cannot be
    taught by any book), still no one can go through the process indicated without gaining
    at least some slight degree of manual skill as well as a fund of practical information and
    experience.
