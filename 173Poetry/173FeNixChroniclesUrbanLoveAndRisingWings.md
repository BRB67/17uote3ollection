### Poetic Life
I want to breath the skies
Grip the earth beneath my feet
Capture the sun with my eyes
Leave the world with all its deceit

I want gravity to defy me 
As I define life within us
I want the right to choose freely
Free from the fear of mistrust

Guide my steady hand across the paper
Hold my thoughts help them linger
Let my pen never faultier
Poetry You are my Savior

My pages are as vast as space
This ink never dries
My words and the stars could trade place
They are endless, like the ocean of skies

With this power in my hands
I shall take what life commands
And write a new story
Never Worry

It's ever changing
Never boring
This I chant every time I write
Demand life's finest for
These words are a part of me like water
They flow through my body like air
Tempest of doubt never
As long as I breathe the words will always be here
