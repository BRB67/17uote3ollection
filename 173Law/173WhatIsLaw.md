### Quote 1

	As written in The King James Version of the Bible in The Second Book
	of Moses: Called Exodus:
	>"20:1 And God spake all these words, saying, 20:2 I am the LORD thy
	God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the 
	house of bondage.
	
	20:3 Thou shalt have no other gods before me.
	
	20:4 Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness
	of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth 
	beneath, or that is in water under the earth.
	
	20:5 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them; for I
	the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the inquity of the 
	fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of 
	them that hate me; 20:6 And shewing mercy unto thousands of them 
	that love me, and keep my commandments.
